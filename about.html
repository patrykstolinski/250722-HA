            Welcome to Xavier's School for gifted Children
        </h2>
        <p>Welcome to Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters — a safe haven and training ground for the next generation of mutants. Founded by Professor Charles Xavier, our mission is simple: to guide young mutants in mastering their unique abilities, to prepare them for a world that may not yet understand them, and to show them that difference is not a weakness — it's power.</p>
        <p>Located in a secluded estate in Westchester County, the school is more than just an educational facility. It’s a community, a sanctuary, and a launchpad for heroes. Our students come from all walks of life, united by one thing: the mutant X-gene.</p>
        <p><h3>Whether you're learning to control optic blasts, manipulate weather, or simply figure out who you are, Xavier’s offers a place to grow, learn, and become something greater.</h3></p>
